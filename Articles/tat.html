        <p class="subHeading" >The Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) is a crucial part of the SSB interview process. This guide equips you with a step-by-step approach to crafting compelling stories that showcase your perception and problem-solving skills.</p>
    <br>
        <h2 class="heading">TAT comprises 3 parts which include:</h2>
        <ol type="1">

            <li>What Will Be the Favourable Outcome.</li>
        </ol>    
        <h2 class="heading">A. What Led to the Situation (Introduction)</h2>
        <p class="para">The introduction sets the stage for your story. Here's what you need to focus on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Introduce the main theme of the story. It should be completed in a maximum of two lines.</li>
            <li>The introduction sets the scene and introduces the situation you've created. This is where your main character will act and perform their actions.</li>
            <li>The introduction should also include a clear problem statement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="subHeading2">Things to keep in mind while writing the introduction:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Maximum 2-3 lines:</strong>Don't just introduce the character, introduce the story itself.</li>
            <li>The introduction should involve a problem statement.</li>
            <li>The problem/situation you create should be solvable within a short period of time.</li>

            <li>This section focuses on the hero's actions. Describe their objective actions, not their feelings or motivations.</li>
            <li>Example: Instead of "He felt sympathetic and decided to help," write "He agreed to help and took out his phone to note down the list."</li>
